# UMDA in continuos space

### @Suavesito-Olimpiada (12-10-2019)

**Description**

This is an implementation of UMDAc (Univariate Marginal Distribution Algorithm for continuous domains). It have some improvement to
allow convergence specially, it adds a never-zero decreasing standard deviation in the data to allow not falling in near-optimal
poins (an not in the optimal) because of the fast convergence rate.
